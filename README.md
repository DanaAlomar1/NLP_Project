Usage

Step 1: Prepare Your Datasets

Training Data: data.csv
Contains the labeled text data for training the models.
Validation Data: validation_data.csv
Contains the text data for validation and prediction.
Step 2: Run the Notebook

Open the model_comparison.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
Execute the cells to:
Preprocess the data.
Train the models.
Evaluate their performance.
Generate predictions for the validation data.
Step 3: Review Results

The notebook displays evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) for each model.
Predictions for the validation data are saved in validation_data_predicted.csv.
Technologies

Python 3.x: Primary programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
scikit-learn: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and documentation.

Results

The following models were trained and evaluated on the text classification task:

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1 Score
Naive Bayes	91.7%	0.92	0.91	0.91
Logistic Regression	98.6%	0.98	0.98	0.98
Random Forest	99.7%	0.99	0.99	0.99
Key Insights

Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (99.7%) and F1 score (0.99).
Logistic Regression performed slightly better than Naive Bayes in all metrics.
All models demonstrated strong performance, with Random Forest being the most effective for this dataset.
How to Customize

Add New Models: Include additional models by adding new code blocks in the notebook.
Modify Metrics: Change the evaluation metrics in the scikit-learn evaluation functions.
Use Different Datasets: Replace data.csv and validation_data.csv with your own datasets.
Next Steps

Experiment with advanced models like BERT or GPT for better performance.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Deploy the best-performing model as an API for real-time predictions.
